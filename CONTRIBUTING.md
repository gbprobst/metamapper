## How can I contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

When [opening a new issue](https://github.com/metamapper-io/metamapper/issues/new/choose), always make sure to fill out the issue template. This step is crucial, as it gives our team insight into what is actually happening so we can quickly triage and resolve your issue.

Please report a single bug per issue.

Provide reproduction steps: List all the steps necessary to reproduce the issue. The person reading your bug report should be able to follow these steps to reproduce your issue with minimal effort.

### Feature Requests

If you would like to suggest an enhancement or ask for a new feature, please open a [feature request](https://github.com/metamapper-io/metamapper/issues/new/choose) via the Issue Tracker. We'll do our best to review your request and respond within 48 hours.

Please try to provide as much details as possible â€“ the primary focus should be on the **problem you are trying to solve** (with examples) and the secondary focus should be on your proposed solution.

### Documentation

Metamapper could always use better documentation. We host our [documentation](https://www.metamapper.io) using [Github](https://github.com/metamapper-io/docs) and [Docusaurus](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus).

Please feel free to open a PR to contribute!

### Pull Requests

**Code contributions are welcomed and encouraged.** We could always use help addressing bugs, questions, and documentation improvements. Scanning through the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/metamapper-io/metamapper/issues) is a good place to start.

For major changes or significant features, we suggest you reach out first and discuss what you'd like to implement and how. This will make sure that your changes are aligned with our vision for Metamapper and that no one else is already working on a similar implementation.

Check out the [Developer Guide](https://github.com/metamapper-io/metamapper) for more details on development environment setup, git workflow, version releases, etc.
